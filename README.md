final master thesis code monash
My master thesis was about annotating and evaluating a video dataset for autonomous agents in real time. 
The creation was done using a custom built annotation tool for jrdb, which can be found here: https://github.com/evendrow/pose_annotation
The evaluation was done in two verticals, based on accuracy and speed. 
For accuracy, I used the AlphaPose, one of the most accurate pose estimation algorithms and 
for speed, I proposed a unique pipeline using YOLO for object detection and HRNET for pose estimation
